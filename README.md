### ETH Global Mexico 2022 entry
This repo shows the code I wrote for my submission at ETH Global Mexico 2022.   
It has since been cleaned for secrets that I accidentally comitted, and will not work if you run it as
it won't connect to the db or show the products.   
   
Please refer to [the Submission on ETH GLOBAL website](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/criptotianguis-mx-eb3dw)
for further detail.

You can see the [demo version live at](https://eth-global-hackathon.vercel.app/) , but the
site will soon be live on [criptotianguis.mx](https://criptotianguis.mx/).
   
   
The app was created using NextJS with Tailwind.    
1) You can see [how to add Tailwind to NextJS here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs).

2) I used Stepzen with Supabase for db, [stepzen/supabase guide](https://stepzen.com/getting-started)
3) And Apollo to query Stepzen: `npm install @apollo/client graphql`
